# Bounties

The Zeus team is putting up the tasks listed below for bounty. Working code must be merged for a user to collect the bounty. To inquire about status of a bounty, to contribute to a bounty, or to proprose a new bounty please email zeusln (at) tutanota (dot) com. Thank you.

## Tor on Android
Payout: 20,000,000 sats (0.2 BTC)

Currently, Zeus on Android requires Orbot to connect to your node over the Tor network. We'd like for users to be able to connect to their node over Tor without the use of Orbot, similar to Samourai Wallet. The user should be able to start and stop the Tor process and get a new identity if possible.

## Tor on iOS
Payout: 20,000,000 sats (0.2 BTC)

Currently, Zeus on iOS cannot connect over Tor. Users looking to connect remotely need a VPN configuration. We'd like for users to be able to connect their node over Tor without the use of another app. The user should be able to start and stop the Tor process and get a new identity if possible.

## Eclair support
Payout: 1,500,000 sats (0.015 BTC)

Currently, Zeus supports remote connections to lnd, c-lightning (through c-lightning-REST and Spark), and lndhub. We'd like for users to connect to Eclair nodes using the [Eclair REST interface](https://acinq.github.io/eclair/).
